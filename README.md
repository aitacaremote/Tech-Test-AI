# **Aitaca AI Intern Test**

## **Context**  
We are looking for a motivated and curious **AI/Data Science Intern** to join our team. 

---

## **General Instructions**  
1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.  
2. Complete the task described below and commit your progress regularly.  
3. Submit your solution by replying to the original email with a link to your repository.  
4. Use a **Jupyter Notebook** or a **Python script** with Markdown cells or comments to explain your approach.

## **Objective**  
You are given a dataset with approximately **200 samples**, each representing one finger. 
(The dataset can be found in this repo: dataset.csv.)

For each finger:
- There are **40 diameter measurements** (in millimeters), taken at regular intervals from the **tip of the finger down to its base** â€” imagine slicing the finger horizontally into 30 sections and measuring the width at each point.
- You are also given the **length of the finger** (in mm).
- Finally, you have the **true ring size**, which is the **measured diameter (in mm) at the position where a ring would normally sit** â€” typically near the base of the finger.

Your task is to explore the dataset and build a model that can **predict the true ring size**, meaning the actual **diameter of the finger where a ring would fit**, based on the full set of diameter measurements and the finger length.

## **Core Tasks**  

### **1. Data Exploration**  
- Explore the dataset freely (e.g., statistics, correlations, distributions).
- Highlight anything you find relevant or unusual.

### **2. Preprocessing**  
- Apply any preprocessing steps you find necessary.
- You don't have to implement all ideas â€” feel free to comment on them instead.

### **3. Model Selection & Training**  
- Choose and train models.
- Briefly explain your choices and what you expect from each model.

### **4. Evaluation**  
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics
- Comment on what worked well, what didnâ€™t, and how things could be improved.

## **Submission Guidelines**  
- Your final submission should include:
  - A Jupyter Notebook or Python script
  - Explanations using Markdown cells or comments
- Time recommendation: **4â€“5 hours max**
